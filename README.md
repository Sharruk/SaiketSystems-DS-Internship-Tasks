# 📉 Telco Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction  
### Saiket Systems – Data Science Internship Tasks

This repository contains the completed **Data Science Internship Tasks** assigned by **Saiket Systems**.  
The project demonstrates an **end-to-end data science workflow** applied to a **Telecom Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction** problem.

The objective is to help telecom businesses **proactively identify at-risk customers** and reduce churn through **data-driven decision-making**.

The project covers data preparation, exploratory analysis, customer segmentation, predictive modeling, model interpretation, and business-driven recommendations.

Each task is organized into a separate folder for clarity, modularity, and easy evaluation.
